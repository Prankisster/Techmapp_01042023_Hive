# Personalized Interactive Timeline/Progress Tracker Website

Welcome to our repository! We are Prakhar Gupta and Abhishek Sahjwani, and we had the opportunity to work on an innovative project provided by TechMapp, a Hyderabad-based start-up. We chose to work on an interactive timeline/progress tracker website, which we found lacking in personalization in most existing progress tracker websites/apps.

## Problem Statement
In online courses, there are often series of videos on a particular topic, but the lack of personalization can make it difficult for learners to progress at their own pace. Our goal was to develop a recommendation system that would address this issue.

## Our Solution
We proposed a framework where the user har to undertake a general course aptitude test, which would provide a score to help our recommendation system personalize the learning experience for each user. After watching a recommended video, an assessment test would evaluate the learner's understanding, with questions categorized as verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and efficiency (memory + speed). Based on these scores, our progress tracker would show the percentage change before and after watching the video, and the system would recommend additional videos to address areas where the learner struggled.
In the above python file named "CODE" the explaination of the algorithm which we came up with is given. There are comments which explain each block of code. 

## Benefits
Our solution provides learners with personalized recommendations, allowing them to build a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced concepts. 

## Further Improvements
We planned of adding voice assistant/search feature to our solution to make it accessible by the differently abled. From the dataset which we create or generate through our algorithm , it can be used to predict the user behaviour before reccommending videos/products to them and also analyse how they consume content. 

## Acknowledgments
We both work with AI/ML and had limited experience in website development. We developed an original ML algorithm for this project, doing the math behind each step after thorough research. We completed this project within five hours, thanks to the support of our mentors at Hack4wire and TechMapp, and the conducive working environment provided by Hive in Gachibowli, Hyderabad.
